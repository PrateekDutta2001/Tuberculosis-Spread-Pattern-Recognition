# Tuberculosis-Spread-Pattern-Recognition

Tuberculosis is a serious health threat, especially for people living with HIV. People living with HIV are more likely than others to become sick with TB. Worldwide, TB is one of the leading causes of death among people living with HIV.Without treatment, as with other opportunistic infections, HIV and TB can work together to shorten lifespan. Someone with untreated latent TB infection and HIV infection is much more likely to develop TB disease during his or her lifetime than someone without HIV infection.

Among people with latent TB infection, HIV infection is the strongest known risk factor for progressing to TB disease. A person who has both HIV infection and TB disease has an AIDS-defining condition. People infected with HIV who also have either latent TB infection or TB disease can be effectively treated. The first step is to ensure that people living with HIV are tested for TB infection. If found to have TB infection, further tests are needed to rule out TB disease. 

Tuberculosis remains a global health problem with an enormous burden of disease, estimated at 10.4 million new cases in 2015. To stop the tuberculosis epidemic, it is critical that we interrupt tuberculosis transmission. Further, the interventions required to interrupt tuberculosis transmission must be targeted to high-risk groups and settings. 

The global rate of decline in tuberculosis incidence is currently 1.5% and will need to increase to 4%â€“5% by 2020 and then to 10% per year by 2025 to meet the World Health Organization End TB Strategy targets. Interrupting tuberculosis transmission is central to achieving the reductions in tuberculosis incidence required to meet the End TB targets. A rate of decline of 10% per year is thought to be achievable, as this was observed during the 1950s and 1960s in Western Europe, where comprehensive tuberculosis control efforts, which included infection control and treatment of M. tuberculosis infection and all forms of tuberculosis, were intensified and universal health coverage and socioeconomic development were expanded.
